## Colorectal Cancer Classifier with EfficientNetB0
This project uses a deep learning model based on EfficientNetB0 to classify colorectal cancer images into various stages, such as low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (IN), adenocarcinoma, and polyp, as well as normal tissue. Built with TensorFlow and deployed using Streamlit, this tool provides predictions along with educational insights on each cancer type and recommendations for precautionary steps.

'Project Overview'

Key Features
Model Architecture: EfficientNetB0, adapted with additional layers for classification.
Classes: Low-grade IN, Adenocarcinoma, High-grade IN, Normal, Polyp, Serrated Adenoma.
User Interface: Intuitive Streamlit interface for image upload, model prediction, and informative descriptions about each stage.
Educational Content: Provides detailed information on each cancer stage and relevant precautions, making it useful for both diagnostic assistance and user education.
Dataset
The model is trained on the Colorectal Cancer WSI dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains labeled images of colorectal cancer tissue, allowing the model to learn to differentiate between various cancerous and non-cancerous stages.

Novelty
Dual Prediction Confidence Display: The interface shows the model's top prediction and a secondary probable class with their confidence scores.
Informative Insights: Each predicted class is accompanied by descriptions of the condition and precautions that users can take, which adds a layer of usability and education to the tool.


Project Workflow
Data Collection and Preprocessing:

Dataset: Colorectal Cancer WSI dataset from Kaggle.

Preprocessing: Images are resized, normalized, and prepared for model input.
Model Training:

Architecture: EfficientNetB0 base with additional layers for the 6-class classification.
Output Layer: 6 classes, each representing a stage or type of colorectal tissue.
Deployment with Streamlit:

Model Loading: The pre-trained model is loaded into the app.
Prediction Interface: Users can upload images for classification, view predictions with confidence scores, and learn about each stage.
Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/colorectal-cancer-classifier.git
cd colorectal-cancer-classifier
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have Python 3.7+ and install the required packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Usage
Upload an Image: Use the upload function in the app to load an image of colorectal tissue.
Get Predictions: The model will classify the image and provide the most probable class, along with confidence levels.
Learn More: Explore additional information about each class for educational insights.
Model and Code Structure
app.py: Main Streamlit application code.
model.py: Model building and loading functions.
